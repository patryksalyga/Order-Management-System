# Order-Management-System
A server-client order management system for a store, designed with a MongoDB database, Express.js backend, and Vue.js frontend. The backend provides RESTful APIs for managing products, categories, orders, and order statuses, while ensuring validation, error handling, and business logic enforcement. The frontend offers a responsive, interactive interface for placing and managing orders, including features like user authentication, product filtering, cart functionality, and secure order submission. Advanced capabilities include JWT-based authentication, file-based database initialization, and feedback management.
